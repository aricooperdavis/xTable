xTimes is a Firefox extension that allows you to download .ipuz files from The Times Cryptic Crosswords.

## Instructions
0. Have a subscription to The Times
1. Install the extension: [from Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/xtimes/) / [Manually](https://github.com/aricooperdavis/xTimes/releases/latest).
2. Navigate to a cryptic crossword on The Times website

## Points of note
* This is my first Firefox extension, so I'm sure I've not done it very well. Please help me make it better by submitting issues and pull requests!
* You need a subscription to be able to access the Puzzles section of The Times website. This extension is not circumnavigating this paywall, and nor should it, it just lets you download the puzzles you pay for to complete offline.
